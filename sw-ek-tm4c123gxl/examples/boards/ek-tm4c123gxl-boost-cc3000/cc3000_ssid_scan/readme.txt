CC3000 WiFi Access Point SSID Scanning Example

This example requires a CC3000 WiFi BoosterPack attached to the
EK-TM4C123GXL LaunchPad.  After booting and initializing the CC3000, the
application initiates a WiFi scan for access points.  When the scan
completes, the SSID, BSSID and security protocol supported by each detected
access point are output on the UART0 connection available over the virtual
COM port connection provided by the board's ICDI debug interface.

To view output from the application, set your host system's serial terminal
to use 115200bps, 8-N-1.

For information on the CC3000 software stack and API, please consult the
wiki at http://processors.wiki.ti.com/index.php/CC3000.
